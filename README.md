## Course Description

Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how it was working before? Want to work together with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these and other problems! 

Git is a popular version control application that can track your code changes, as well as help you to be more methodical in your programming. Win-win! This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your changes to a project, and using GitHub (a hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.

### We will cover:

• the basic concepts of version control 

• the differences between Git and other version control applications

• fundamental Git commands to track changes to a small project

• the basics of collaborating on code with other developers 

• how to use GitHub 

Teacher's assistants will be on hand to assist you with questions and overcome roadblocks.

Want to try Git for yourself? Github has a 15-minute tutorial you can go through on your own at [TryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).


### Prerequisites:

**1. A willingness to use the command line.**

We will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class.

**2. A laptop with Git already installed. (Don't forget a charger, too!)**

For Mac users, [http://git-scm.com/download/mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)
For Windows users, [https://git-for-windows.github.io/](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

**3. A Github account. **

Sign up for free at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

This class will not use code when committing to a GitHub repository (we'll stick with text!), so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language.
